Spam SMS Detection
Overview
Spam SMS Detection is a machine learning project designed to classify text messages as either spam or ham (legitimate). The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a classification algorithm to detect unwanted or fraudulent SMS messages.

Features
Preprocessing of SMS text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, etc.)

Implementation of machine learning models for classification

Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Real-time detection of spam messages

Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Pandas

NumPy

Flask (for web interface, if applicable)

Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing SMS messages categorized as spam or ham. The dataset can be sourced from public repositories such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Manishkr72/Spam-SMS-Detection
Navigate to the project directory:

cd spam-sms-detection
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the script to train the model:

python train.py
Test the model with a sample input:

Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using various metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Results can be visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.

Future Improvements
Integration with mobile applications

Enhancement of NLP techniques for better accuracy

Deployment as a cloud-based API
