# the use of django.contib------
# This imports Django's built-in admin module.
# The Django admin panel allows superusers to manage models (like adding, editing, or deleting records) through a web-based interface.
# Typically, the admin site is enabled in a project by including admin.site.urls in the urlpatterns.

# the use of django.urls----------------
# This imports the path function from django.urls, which is used to define URL patterns in Django.
# path() is used to map URLs to specific views in your Django application.

# the use of .import views-----------
# This imports the views.py file from the same directory (indicated by .).
# It allows you to reference view functions in your urls.py file.

# admin: Enables Djangoâ€™s admin panel.
# path: Defines URL routes for views.
# views: Connects views.py functions to the URLs.
